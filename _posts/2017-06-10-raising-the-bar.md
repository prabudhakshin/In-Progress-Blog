We all want to hire great people. Hiring is a skill. It involves two parts -- selling the candidate on the opportunity & the ability to assess in a short amount of time. I believe the height of ambition is a direct function of this skill. I have documented almost every interview I have taken in the last two years and what I learned from each of them. I'll publish a blog post on that later. However, if there's one pattern that obviously stood out it's the mistake of saying 'yes' when you are a 'maybe'. It's obviously tempting because you are in pain without the hire and you see a painkiller right in front of you.

How to resist the temptation? Here are 3 questions that have helped me clear my mind: 

[1] Will I be OK if there were 50 people in the company like this candidate?  
[2] Will I be OK reporting to the candidate?  
[3] If there was no budget allotted for this role, would I fight to make one
for this candidate?    

I do #1 & #3 for all candidates. Question #2 is usually reserved for execs. Hiring is a game of increasing the odds of success and this has certainly helped me. As [Robert De Niro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hnhvWKMqm4) says in the movie Ronin, "Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt". 

**Caveat:**  
There was one candidate who was a 'maybe' and I would have said 'no' to #1 but
ended up being a great performer. In a constant pursuit to master this art.
