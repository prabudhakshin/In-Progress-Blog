I am realizing that the toughest and most important quality to be an effective founder is the ability to bounce back to a &#8216;normal&#8217; state even after a low moment. the quicker you figure out what your *painkiller* is, the more effective you become.

highs & lows are a part of the startup journey and the ability for the &#8216;lows&#8217; or annoying issues (which adds very little value) to **not** affect your productivity is important.

a painkiller can vary from a 30-min nap or watching an elon musk interview or  anything else that&#8217;ll get you back to the normal state.
