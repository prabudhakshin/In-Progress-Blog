title:  "One word a day"
---

Recently I got interest in learning something small on a daily basis and found it very powerful. Want to spread this idea to teach school going kids by letting them learn one simple English word a day and see how their vocabulary grows over a long period of time. Idea is, you set up a whatsapp group and send parents just one word a day from this list and let the parents teach the word along with a few example sentences to the kids. Since it's just one word a day, hopefully kids don't show too much of resistance to learn it.

## List of words to teach kids
1. Pierce
2. Incessant
3. Intermittant
4. Comprehensive
5. Thorn
