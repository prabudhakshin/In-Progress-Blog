History says it. The disruption in [automobile industry][1] wasn&#8217;t from Ford, the disruption in [travel & renting industry][2] wasn&#8217;t from the CEO of Hilton, the disruption in [phone industry][3] wasn&#8217;t from Nokia or Motorola and so on..

Being inexperienced in something gives you the liberty to question anything. There are no rules. One of India&#8217;s famous directors, [Mani Ratnam][4]Â once told about a shot in his film. He never went to a film school and didn&#8217;t receive any formal training from any director. In one of his movies, he had asked the cameraman to tilt the camera and put it in a weird position. The cameraman (an experienced one) said that&#8217;s not possible and it doesn&#8217;t work like that. He insisted on doing it and the shot came out beautifully. The cameraman later asked Mani on how he learnt this technique, to which he replied &#8220;*Is this a technique? I don&#8217;t know about any techniques. I just thought it might be an interesting shot*&#8221;

The same holds true while building a company. It&#8217;s essential that the teams working on different operations should interact with each other. The best sales idea might come from a developer and the best way to plan out task deadlines and schedule might come from a marketing person.. who knows. They have no rules.

*Unlearning  
*This leads to an interesting aspect of &#8220;unlearning&#8221;. It essentially means if you have to grow fast in your role and invent something new, you will have to be willing to unlearn what you already know. And it&#8217;s going to be damn hard to do that because the question that&#8217;ll popup immediately is, *this has been working for decades, how can we change it?* At that instant, I point them <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U" target="_blank">to this video</a>.

*Lame or disruption  
*So, why don&#8217;t we hire a team full of inexperienced people? we can disrupt the disruption. The risk in all these new ideas is it can either be a completely innovative one or can be totally lame.

*Powerful team  
*In essence, a powerful team would consist of a right mix of experience and young blood, with every department interacting with another on a regular basis, and everyone willing to unlearn what they already know.
