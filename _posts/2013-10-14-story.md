When you narrate your story to your future generations, it&#8217;ll be a boring one if you keep winning all the time. That&#8217;s why you lose some battles. Believe in something that you&#8217;ll die for, get someone who will be with you till the end, fight like a maniac and you&#8217;ll win the war that matters the most. Godspeed
