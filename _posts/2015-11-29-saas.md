The future of enterprise SaaS software is going to be very different from what it is right now. Companies will build software but will sell something else - data or intelligence or any defensible asset that's created because of signing up a lot of customers. You can already see Zenefits following this. Coming to think of it, this is such a huge potential for the entire SaaS market. You have the "loyalty" of the enterprise business and the growth of consumer internet companies. That sure can make a powerful company!
