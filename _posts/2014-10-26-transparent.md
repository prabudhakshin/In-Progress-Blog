a big part of the reason why a founder takes a decision in a particular way is the access to different pieces of information she has. this can range from financials to impact on other orgs, people, other feature requests in queue, how doing X be perceived by users, etc.

if you&#8217;d like everyone in the company to take the same decision that you&#8217;d have taken (if you were in that situation), then it&#8217;s only logical that you should provide the same set of information to everyone.

of course, there are going to be things that are extremely sensitive which can&#8217;t be shared <sup>[1]</sup> but the only way you can empower everyone to make a &#8220;smart&#8221; decision is by being transparent and communicating as much as possible.

two things we&#8217;re doing and has been effective is  
a. dedicate a 2 hour time slot/week with me for anyone in the company to just drop in and discuss about why we are/aren&#8217;t doing a particular thing in a particular way

b. global themed monthly meeting &#8211; product, sales, marketing, etc. with the head of that particular org talking about progress, achievements, things to improve, floating for new ideas, etc. this makes sure everyone is in sync with what&#8217;s going in the entire company.

would love to hear more thoughts.

**[1] the things that are extremely sensitive to be shared publicly are usually not needed to take the decision
